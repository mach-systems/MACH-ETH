# MACH-ETH
The MACH-ETH is an automotive network interface that features one Ethernet port, two CAN FD channels, a LIN channel, a USB and RS-232 port, and multiple I/Os. The device offers an open communication protocol over Ethernet and USB to access CAN(/FD) and LIN channel. On top of that, the device's firmware is fully programmable by the user.

This repository contains the MACH-SDK C language SDK - an STM32CubeIDE example project that shows the usage of all peripherals. Detailed description can be found in main.c.
